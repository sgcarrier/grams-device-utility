# GRAMS Device Utility

Python scripts to control commonly used in GRAMS boards

## Basic setting up

If the library is already installed on the board (this is the case if you're using the default image generated by 
Yocto/Petalinux). Then you only need to do the following:

```python
from platforms.CHARTIER.CHARTIER import CHARTIER

board = CHARTIER()
```

Setup the logging with:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## How to make scripts

Accessing registers of different components follows a format:

for reading:
board_variable.COMPONENT_NAME.REGISTER_NAME(device_number)

for writing: board_variable.COMPONENT_NAME.REGISTER_NAME(device_number, newValue)

For example:

```python
from platforms.CHARTIER.CHARTIER import CHARTIER

board = CHARTIER()

# Going to read the register LOS of the LMK03318 number 0
retValue = board.LMK03318.LOS(0)

# Going to write to the VNDRID register of the LMK03318 number 1
board.LMK03318.VNDRID(1, 123) # This will fail, VNDRID is a read-only register
```

The previous example can be done in a script or in a Python console. Component names and registers should have 
TAB-completion so you don't have to remember them all in the console.
